Buyer Home Feature Documentation

1. Executive Summary

The Buyer Home feature in the CropGuard mobile application serves as the main dashboard for buyers, providing a welcoming and intuitive interface to explore products, view offers, and access essential shopping tools. It is designed to enhance the buyer's experience by offering personalized recommendations, quick navigation to product categories, and real-time updates on orders and promotions.

2. User Experience and Flow

- The buyer logs into our app and is greeted by the Buyer Home screen.
- The Home screen displays:
  - A personalized welcome message.
  - Featured products and promotional banners.
  - Quick access to product categories (e.g., Fruits, Vegetables, Grains).
  - Search bar for finding products.
  - Shortcuts to Cart, Orders, Favorites, and Notifications.
  - Recent orders or recommended products section.
- The user can tap any product or category to view details or start shopping.
- The Home screen updates in real time as new products, offers, or notifications become available.

3. Architecture Overview

Frontend (Flutter):
- UI: Dashboard layout with banners, product carousels, category buttons, and navigation shortcuts.
- State Management: Provider/Bloc/Riverpod for managing home data and updates.
- API Integration: Service class (e.g., ApiConsumer) for fetching products, offers, and notifications.

Backend:
- RESTful API endpoints for fetching featured products, categories, offers, and notifications.
- Database queries to deliver personalized recommendations and real-time updates.
- Responds with JSON data for products, offers, and user-specific content.

4. Important Code Snippets (From Our Codebase)

A. Fetching Home Data (buyer_home_cubit.dart)
---------------------------------------------
Future<void> fetchHomeData() async {
  emit(BuyerHomeLoading());
  try {
    final featured = await buyerHomeRepository.getFeaturedProducts();
    final categories = await buyerHomeRepository.getCategories();
    final offers = await buyerHomeRepository.getOffers();
    emit(BuyerHomeLoaded(featured, categories, offers));
  } catch (e) {
    emit(BuyerHomeError(e.toString()));
  }
}

B. Displaying Home Screen (buyer_home_view.dart)
-----------------------------------------------
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return BlocBuilder<BuyerHomeCubit, BuyerHomeState>(
    builder: (context, state) {
      if (state is BuyerHomeLoading) {
        return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
      } else if (state is BuyerHomeLoaded) {
        return ListView(
          children: [
            WelcomeBanner(userName: state.userName),
            FeaturedProductsCarousel(products: state.featured),
            CategoryGrid(categories: state.categories),
            OffersBanner(offers: state.offers),
            ShortcutRow(onTapShortcut: _handleShortcut),
            RecommendedSection(products: state.recommended),
          ],
        );
      } else if (state is BuyerHomeError) {
        return Center(child: Text('Error: ${state.message}'));
      }
      return Container();
    },
  );
}

C. Navigating to Features (shortcut_row.dart)
---------------------------------------------
void _handleShortcut(ShortcutType type) {
  switch (type) {
    case ShortcutType.cart:
      context.go('/cart');
      break;
    case ShortcutType.orders:
      context.go('/orders');
      break;
    case ShortcutType.favorites:
      context.go('/favorites');
      break;
    case ShortcutType.notifications:
      context.go('/notifications');
      break;
    // Add more cases as needed
  }
}

6. Summary

The Buyer Home feature acts as the central hub for buyers, offering a personalized, real-time dashboard and seamless navigation to all shopping features. In our code, the flow is: UI dashboard → API calls for products/offers → backend aggregation → UI updates, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.
